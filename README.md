## Project Overview

eKYC-DF is a large-scale deepfake dataset designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of eKYC systems. It contains a diverse collection of deepfakes generated using various techniques, targeting different biometric modalities, and showcasing varying levels of sophistication. This dataset aims to address the lack of readily available and diverse deepfake resources for eKYC research and development.
